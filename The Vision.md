# The Vision

**Project Synapse: Build the Brain You've Always Wanted**

Have you ever had this happen?

You find a groundbreaking article on system design. You screenshot a brilliant design on a portfolio site. You're deep in a research session on Perplexity, and the AI generates the perfect results you've been looking for. You even write down a genius idea on a physical notebook and snap a picture of it.

You tell yourself, "I'll save this for later."

And then... it's gone. Lost in number of bookmarks, a camera roll full of random images, and a dozen untitled note files. Your best ideas are forgotten.

What if you had a second brain? A private, intelligent space that didn't just *store* what you save, but truly *understood* it. What if finding something you saved a year ago was as easy as a simple thought?

**Your mission is to bring this vision to life.**

**Imagine the Experience -**

**1. Capture Any Thought, Instantly:** You're on any page, in any site. A single click, a highlight, or a simple command is all it takes. The thought is captured, effortlessly and forever.

- You see a product you love. You click on a button and it's saved, not just as a url, but as a product with its name and price.
- You're researching on Perplexity. Instead of losing that perfect AI-generated research, you simply tell it: **"Save this to Synapse."** It's captured as a clean, readable article.
- You write your todo’s on any site. You highlight it and click a small icon. The todo is saved, not just as text, but as a beautifully formatted list.

**2. Explore Your Visual Mind:** Later, you open your Synapse, log in to your account. What you see is not just a list of blue links. It’s a beautiful, visual tapestry of your thoughts.

- The **to-do** list you snapped a photo of should look like a list.
- The **book** you wanted to read looks like a book, with its cover and author.
- The **laptops** you were considering are a product card, complete with the price you saw.
- The **youtube video** you saved links of is playable via embed.

Everything is presented in the most useful, beautiful way possible, automatically.

**3. Search Like You Think:** This is where the magic happens. You don't need to remember file names or tags. You just search your memory. You open the search bar and ask:

- *"Show me articles about AI I saved last month."*
- *"Find that quote about new beginnings from the handwritten note I saved."*
- *"What did Karpathy say about tokenization in that paper?"*
- *"Black leather shoes under $300."*
- *"Inspiration for a travel blog logo."*
- *"My to-do list for yesterday."*

But not limited to these.

Your Synapse understands and instantly finds exactly what you're looking for.

**The Challenge:**

Build a working prototype that delivers this experience. Focus on creating a system that feels intelligent, intuitive, and magical. The specifics of the implementation are up to you.

Good luck.
